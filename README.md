# A.M.-Guerry-s-Moral-Statistics

In response to the 1830s crime boom in France, 
A.M. Guerry adopted a novel approach of trying to document the "morality" of different territories in France,
creating a first-of-its-kind dataset he called Moral Statistics.

I revisit Guerry's dataset equipped with the modern tool of regression analysis ad mapping software
to take up Guerry's task of understanding crime rates in the 1830s in France.
